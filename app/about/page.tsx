        <p>Hello world, I'm Conner</p>

        <p>
          I'm a full-stack developer with 4+ years of experience currently
          seeking a Senior Software or Founding Engineer role in the Bay Area.
          My main expertise is in scalable frontend development using React,
          which I've previously done for both large organizations as well as
          fledgling startups.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a software engineer, I blend my background in human-computer
          interaction and passion for efficiency with my lifelong zeal for
          building, creating, and fixing things. I love being able to create
          strong, intuitive, and lasting products that people can intuitively
          connect with. I'm mainly interested in a senior development role where
          I can use my skills to help guide a team while contining to build
          experience in project management and product architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll most likely find me gaming, golfing,
          surfing music sites, watching basketball, or tinkering away on a
          project.
